# ❄ bifröst - Community Comic Book Manager
## About

Bifröst is a single-page comic book management application that combines new comic book discovery with an integrated social, user-sharing platform. Inspired by the community-based reading application Goodreads, bifröst allows users to curate a personal reading or pull-list of comics and share these selections in a continuous public timeline.

Bifröst is composed of a React frontend—styled with [React Bulma Components](https://github.com/couds/react-bulma-components) and [FontAwesome icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fortawesome/react-fontawesome), and a backend composed of an [ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/?view=aspnetcore-5.0) API with a Microsoft SQL Server database. Additionally, Bifröst uses Google Firebase for user authentication.
